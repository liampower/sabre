With the rise in power of consumer graphics hardware, it becomes possible to
simulate and render increasingly large and complex virtual environments in games. Voxel-based technology --- first introduced as a means to visualise medical and scientific datasets --- is an innovative alternative to contemporary polygon-based techniques for representing massive game worlds that can be modified in real-time.

A significant problem faced by game programmers when integrating voxels into
their product is the overhead of developing a robust voxel storage and rendering
scheme, as naive storage of voxels can consume huge amounts of memory. In place of 
developing such a solution in-house, developers may instead choose to utilise a 
library to provide the voxel storage and rendering technology.

This project aims to deliver such a library. Through the use of specialised data 
structures and the exploitation of the inherently parallel nature of voxel data,
this project provides drop-in support for massive voxel scenes that can be viewed
at a very high level of detail using modern OpenGL graphics programming techniques. 
In addition to this core library, this project also provides an example viewer application
demonstrating the capabilities of the library.

Since this project is designed for easy integration, the core voxel library does
not rely upon any external dependencies, other than the OpenGL graphics API for
interfacing with the graphics hardware.
