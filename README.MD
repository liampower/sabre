# Sabre: A Sparse Voxel Octree Renderer

![Gallery Scene](misc/screenshot.jpg "Gallery Scene")

Sabre is a [Sparse Voxel Octree](http://www.hyperfun.org/TRP/LaineKarras_EffOctrees_TVCG11.pdf)
renderer. SVOs allow huge voxel worlds to be rendered at interactive frame rates
through raycasting. This project also supports interactive SVO modifications.
